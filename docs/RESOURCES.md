## Linting
F# projects (.fsproj) can be linted for further code analysis via a third party tool - [FSharpLint](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpLint).

To use this, just follow the directions from the wiki page to use the [command line tool](https://github.com/duckmatt/FSharpLint/wiki/Console-Application).
