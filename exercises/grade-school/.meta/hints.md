## Hints
For this exercise the following F# feature comes in handy:
- The [Map](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/F_Sharp_Programming/Sets_and_Maps#Maps) type associates keys with values. It is very similar to .NET's `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` type, but with one major difference: `Map` is [immutable](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/correctness-immutability/).
