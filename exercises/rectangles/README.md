# Rectangles

Count the rectangles in an ASCII diagram like the one below.

```text
   +--+
  ++  |
+-++--+
|  |  |
+--+--+
```

The above diagram contains 6 rectangles:

```text


+-----+
|     |
+-----+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   |  |
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   +--+


```

```text


   +--+
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text


+--+
|  |
+--+
```

```text

  ++
  ++


```

You may assume that the input is always a proper rectangle (i.e. the length of
every line equals the length of the first line).

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.
